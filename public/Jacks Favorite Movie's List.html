<h1>The most excellent movies according to Jack</h1>

<h2>My top three fav films to watch over and over again.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Terminator 2</h3>

<p>In this film the Terminator returns but this time, to protect a young boy who will grow up to be a leader of the resistance against the machines, action packed scenes, teenager attitude and Sara Conner returns to be one bad ass woman
    in this timeless action packed movie that still ranks highly up there in the sci-fi genre.</p>


<h3>The Matrix</h3>

<p>In this film a computer hacker meets Morpheus the red pill pusher and defender of Zion, the unplugged world of the Matrix show us a reality where we are batteries for the machine, once unplugged we can connect via phone lines,
    the entire matrix is a computer simulation where we are plugged into. Worth a watch and definatly action packed and once again Trinnity will lead the way Neo!</p> 


<h3>UnderWorld</h3>

<p>I mean Kate Beckinsale in leather, and of course vampires vs werewolfs attacking each other and Victor finally meets his match, Michael the soon to be hybrid is about to be born, also vampires and werewolfs, and leather.</p>
