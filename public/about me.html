<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm JackRH, I am a father and a gamer, cat dad and husband to a wonderful wife. She is very supportive of me and my journy. My child is awesome, he has the same loves as his father, loves space and nature. Speaking of Space... Star Wars! This is the way, I love you... I know. Luke I am your father. You get the idea.</p>

<p>I love nature a lot, soon I plan on buying land for a garden, lots of wildflowers for the honey bees, I wll definatly have a colony of them or 2 hives.</p>

<p>These about me's can be boring and tedius to read, either way thank you for visiting my page. Cheers!</p>
